      <h3>Strategic design & digital empowerment</h3>
      <p class="cons_p_main">Our services are very much client-specific and tailored. Needs and requirements are different, so are our approaches to them. We deliberately avoid ready models to remain open-minded and creative.</p>
      <p class="cons_p">DVG teams conduct major projects like general digital transformation or specific engagements like digital labs and spin-out tech ventures. We do support new entrepreneurs by helping startups and scaleups. At any stage of the product design and development there are tools and solutions that we can offer to technology businesses in the industries like financial services, telecoms, logistics & transportation, construction etc. We also work with the government sector for major digital transformations or other implementations that need agile approach and hard engineering skills. DVG also provides practical workshops and training sessions on innovation awareness and product ownership that help clients formulate their digital agenda within the respective organizations. </p>
